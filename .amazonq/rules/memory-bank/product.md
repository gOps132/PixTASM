# PixTASM - Product Overview

## Project Purpose
PixTASM is a web-based pixel art editor specifically designed for creating graphics that can be exported to TASM (Turbo Assembler) format. It bridges the gap between modern pixel art creation and retro assembly programming by providing an intuitive drawing interface with direct assembly code generation.

## Key Features
- **Grid-based Drawing**: Variable grid size selection for creating pixel art on customizable canvases
- **Color Palette System**: Dual color palette support with background and foreground colors matching classic 8-bit systems
- **ASCII Character Support**: Ability to place ASCII characters (0-255) in grid cells with foreground/background color attributes
- **TASM Export**: Direct export functionality to generate Turbo Assembler compatible sprite data
- **Persistence**: Save/load functionality for preserving work across sessions
- **Multiple Drawing Tools**: Drawing, erasing, and planned fill tools for efficient artwork creation
- **Blinking Support**: Color attribute support for blinking effects (intensity control)

## Target Users
- **Retro Game Developers**: Creating sprites and graphics for assembly language games
- **Assembly Programmers**: Generating visual assets that integrate directly with TASM projects  
- **Pixel Artists**: Artists interested in creating artwork with technical constraints and export capabilities
- **Educators**: Teaching pixel art creation within the context of low-level programming

## Use Cases
- Creating character sprites for retro-style games
- Designing UI elements for assembly language applications
- Educational projects combining art and programming
- Generating test graphics for assembly development
- Converting modern pixel art concepts to assembly-compatible formats

## Value Proposition
PixTASM eliminates the tedious manual process of converting pixel art to assembly data structures by providing a visual editor that directly outputs properly formatted TASM code, making retro game development more accessible and efficient.
